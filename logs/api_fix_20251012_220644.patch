The error message indicates that the TypeScript compiler has detected a parameter named `agent` in the `dashboard.controller.ts` file that does not have an explicit type defined, leading to it being implicitly assigned the `any` type. To resolve this, you need to explicitly define the type of the `agent` parameter.

Here's a minimal code fix in unified diff patch format:

```diff

+++ src/dashboard/dashboard.controller.ts

 // Example function where the error occurs
 function exampleFunction(agent) {
-    // function implementation
+    function exampleFunction(agent: YourAgentType) {
     // function implementation
 }
```

In this patch, replace `YourAgentType` with the actual type that `agent` should be. This will resolve the TypeScript error by providing an explicit type for the `agent` parameter.
